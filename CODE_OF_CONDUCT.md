# Code of conduct for the numba-mpi open-source project

As [contributors and maintainers of this project](https://github.com/orgs/numba-mpi/people),
and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all
people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating 
documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of level of technical experience and regardless of any non-technical
personal characteristic or identity trait (gender, religion, physicality, age, ethnicity,
essentially **any**).

Nurturing open and unemotional code reviews and community discussions, we aim at ensuring
fruitful and enriching collaboration experience and maintaining quality engineering
standards. This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Breaching project security (e.g., granting GitHub access rights without ensuring
  collaborators' consent);
* Breaching collaborators' privacy (e.g., publishing other's private information without
  permission);
* Force developments (e.g., merging or releasing against expressed collaborators' comments
  against doing it);
* Any form of harassing language of exclusion;
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct (if in doubt, ask!).

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct,
or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem
inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. By adopting this Code of Conduct, project
maintainers commit themselves to fairly, consistently and collaboratively applying these
principles to every aspect of managing this project. 

Reporting actions that are violating the hereby Code of Conduct can be done publicly on the
project GitHub space, or if needed, can be reported directly to any of the
[project maintainers listed on GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/numba-mpi/people)
(as of the time of writing: Sylwester Arabas, David Zwicker, Kacper Derlatka, et al.).
Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of a
privately reported incident.

Please note that, as of time of writing, the entirety of the project team is engaged in the
development purely on voluntary basis.
